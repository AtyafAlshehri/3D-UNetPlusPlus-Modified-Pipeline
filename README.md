##  Overview
This project provides a reproducible implementation of a hierarchical deep learning framework for **cardiac cine-MRI segmentation and disease classification** using a modified **3D UNet++** architecture and quantitative feature extraction.

## Usage Instructions

Clone or download this repository.

Place the ACDC dataset in the /Dataset folder.

Run ACDC_Preprocessing.ipynb to normalize and resample images.

Run ACDC_Model_Segmentation.ipynb to train or test the 3D UNet++ segmentation model.

Run feature_extraction_and_classification.ipynb to extract features and classify cardiac diseases.

## Methodology

The pipeline follows the stages described in the manuscript:

Preprocessing: Normalization, resampling, and augmentation of cine-MRI data.

Segmentation: Lightweight 3D UNet++ model for LV/RV/MYO segmentation.

Feature Extraction: Quantitative LV, RV, and MYO measurements (volumes, ratios, contraction indices).

Classification: Disease classification into NOR, DCM, HCM, MINF, and RV abnormality groups.
